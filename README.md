list of my custom dotfile and configuration


## Evoluent mouse configuration ("90-evoluent.conf")
My evoluent mouse as the backward button on the third button of the mouse, that makes it not practical, since I keep pressing it without wanting.  
Here is a config file to remap the button in xorg, by disabling the third button, and moving the "going backward" to the thumb button.
 
### Set up
The configuration file needs to be but in "/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/" (as sudo)
Then on session restart the mapping should be set.
